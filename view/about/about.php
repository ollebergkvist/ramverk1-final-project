        CodeWizards was developed as the final project in the course
        <a href="https://dbwebb.se/kurser/ramverk1-v2">"Ramverk1"
            ("Framework1")</a> at
        <a href="https://www.bth.se/eng/">Blekinge Institute of
            Technology</a>
        in the Autumn/Winter 2020 by Software Engineer student
        <a href="https://www.ollebergkvist.com">Olle Bergkvist</a>. The course
        teaches programming and object-oriented code
        structures with design
        patterns and module thinking around reusable modules in web-based
        frameworks as well as techniques for automated testing, building
        systems
        and flow for continuous integration of the software.

    <p> This
        application is designed as a hybrid between a classic
        discussion board and a more modern question/answer approach like
        <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow,</a> containing
        logic and functionality from
        both worlds. The application was
        developed using the following
        technologies:
        Vanilla PHP, <a href="https://github.com/canax">ANAX (Laravel inspired
            PHP Framework)</a>, SQlite, HTML, CSS,
        Bootstrap and Bash (Postprocessing scripts) and designed with the
        following design patterns in mind:
        MVC, DRY and KISS.
